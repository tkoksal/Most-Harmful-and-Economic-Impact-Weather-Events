# Most-Harmful-and-Economic-Impact-Weather-Events

This project involves exploring the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database as to what types of weather events are most harmful to population health and have the greatest economic consequences. The storm database is firstly cleaned and prepared for analysis. Being harmful to population health is measured through the number of fatalities and number of injuries. Economic consequences are measured through the cost of property damage. As a result of the analysis, most harmful events to population health in terms of fatalities have been found to be tornado, excessive heat, heat, and flash flood. In terms of injuries, most harmful weather events are tornado, thunderstorm wind, flood, excessive heat, and lightning. Events having the greatest economic consequences have been found to be flood, hurricane/typhoon, tornado, and storm surge/tide.
